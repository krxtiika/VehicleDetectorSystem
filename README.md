# VehicleDetectorSystem

Vehicle Detector & Counter Code using Python and OpenCV

This Python-based project leverages OpenCV to detect and count vehicles in real-time from video feeds. The application utilizes computer vision techniques to identify vehicles, track their movement, and maintain an accurate count of the vehicles passing a predefined line.

Features:
1) Real-time Detection: Processes video frames in real-time to detect vehicles using Haar Cascades or a deep learning model (e.g., YOLO or SSD).

2) Counting Mechanism: Implements a counting logic that increments the count as vehicles cross a specified line on the video feed.

3) Visualization: Displays the video feed with bounding boxes around detected vehicles, along with the current count displayed on the screen.

4) Background Subtraction: Utilizes background subtraction methods to enhance vehicle detection by distinguishing moving objects from static backgrounds.

5) Data Output: Optionally saves vehicle count data to a file for further analysis or reporting.

Requirements:
1) Python 3.x
2) OpenCV
3) NumPy
4) Optionally, TensorFlow or PyTorch for advanced models

Use Cases:

1) Traffic Monitoring: Ideal for monitoring traffic flow on roads.
2) Parking Management: Helps in counting vehicles entering or exiting a parking area.
3) Research and Development: Useful for academic projects in computer vision and machine learning.

This vehicle detector and counter application is a practical implementation of real-time object detection and can be easily extended or integrated into larger systems for enhanced functionality.
